This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
setwd("~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Data Science/OHMS_Data-Analysis/OHMS_R_Studio")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r Setup Import of Data Files for Exploratory Data Analysis}
df_DockAccess <- read.csv('Data/BldgDockAccess.csv')
df_ConstSite <- read.csv('Data/ConstructionSite.csv')
df_ProjInfo <- read.csv('Data/ProjectInformation.csv')
df_SiteCond <- read.csv('Data/SiteConditions.csv')
```
```{r}
